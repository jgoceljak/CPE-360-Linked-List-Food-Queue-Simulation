Option 2 works best based to the test we have run, on avearge it has the lower avearge wait times and this makes sense since this is the way most stores do it.
This may be because customers are split in 2 differnt lines instead of one big one so there are half the amount of people infront of them. This has a greater 
impact than the line just moving faster.
